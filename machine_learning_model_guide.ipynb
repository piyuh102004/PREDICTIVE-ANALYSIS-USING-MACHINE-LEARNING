    "# Machine Learning Model Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides an overview of the predictive analysis model implemented in the Jupyter notebook `machine_learning_model_predictive_analysis.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The predictive analysis model uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict outcomes based on a dataset. The process includes data loading, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and saving the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Involved\n",
    "1. **Load the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded using Pandas. Ensure to replace the placeholder filename with your actual dataset.\n",
    "2. **Handle Missing Values**: The code checks for missing values and handles them by dropping or filling.\n",
    "3. **Encode Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables are encoded using Label Encoding.\n",
    "4. **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler.\n",
    "5. **Feature Selection**: The top features are selected using SelectKBest.\n",
    "6. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.\n",
    "7. **Model Training**: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training set.\n",
    "8. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy score and classification report.\n",
    "9. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV is used to find the best hyperparameters for the model.\n",
    "10. **Save the Model**: The trained model is saved using joblib.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Notebook\n",
    "To run the notebook, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the `machine_learning_model_predictive_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to see the results."
