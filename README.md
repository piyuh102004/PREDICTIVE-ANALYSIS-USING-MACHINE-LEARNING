This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict outcomes based on a dataset. The model uses a Random Forest Classifier and includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and saving the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Open the `machine_learning_model_predictive_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the cells sequentially to see the results.

### Model Overview
The predictive analysis model includes:
- Data loading and exploration
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Saving the trained model

Feel free to customize the dataset path and target column name as needed.
